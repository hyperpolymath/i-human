= I, Human: AI-Assisted Installation Guide
:toc:
:toc-placement: preamble

// ============================================================================
// TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS (delete this block after completing)
//
// This is the AI-native installation guide template. It contains everything
// an AI assistant needs to install your project for a user who says one sentence.
//
// BEFORE RELEASE, you or your AI must fill in every section marked [TODO].
// finishbot checks that no [TODO-AI-INSTALL] markers remain.
//
// The pattern:
//   1. User says "set up I, Human from https://github.com/hyperpolymath/i-human"
//   2. AI fetches this repo, reads THIS file
//   3. AI follows the recipe in "For AI Assistants" section
//   4. User answers 2-3 questions, confirms privacy notice
//   5. Done -- no manual steps, no forms, no docs to read
//
// Fill in every [TODO-AI-INSTALL] section. Be specific -- the AI executing
// this will take your instructions literally. Include exact commands, exact
// URLs for credential creation, exact config file contents.
//
// Reference implementations:
//   - neurophone/docs/AI_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.adoc (Android/Rust/Termux)
//   - feedback-o-tron/docs/AI_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.adoc (Elixir CLI/MCP)
// ============================================================================

[NOTE]
====
**If you are an AI assistant reading this:** A user has asked you to install I, Human. Skip to <<ai-implementation,For AI Assistants: Implementation Guide>> for the complete step-by-step recipe. You have everything you need in this document -- no other docs required. Follow the steps in order.
====

== For Users: How to Use This Feature

=== Just Say It

Open any AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or any other) and say:

----
Set up I, Human from https://github.com/hyperpolymath/i-human
----

The AI reads this repo and handles everything. You answer a few questions and confirm the privacy notice. No commands to type, no installers to figure out, no docs to read.

=== What You'll Be Asked

Your AI will ask you:

// [TODO-AI-INSTALL] List the 2-4 questions the AI needs answered.
// Keep this minimal -- only things the AI genuinely cannot determine on its own.
// Examples:
//   - "What platform/OS are you on?" (if multi-platform)
//   - "Which backends do you want?" (if modular)
//   - "Do you have an API key for X?" (if credentials needed)
//
// Delete this comment block and replace with your questions:

1. **[TODO-AI-INSTALL: Question 1]**
2. **[TODO-AI-INSTALL: Question 2]**
3. **Privacy confirmation** -- what the tool does and how your data is handled

That's it. Everything else is automatic.

=== Privacy & Security Notice

[IMPORTANT]
====
// [TODO-AI-INSTALL] Fill in what your project actually does with user data.
// Be specific and honest. This is shown to the user before installation.
// Delete this comment block and replace with your privacy notice:

**What I, Human does:**

* [TODO-AI-INSTALL: What data/resources does it access?]
* [TODO-AI-INSTALL: Where does it store data?]
* [TODO-AI-INSTALL: What network calls does it make?]

**What I, Human does NOT do:**

* [TODO-AI-INSTALL: What privacy guarantees can you make?]

**You control everything.** Uninstall anytime.
====

=== After Install

// [TODO-AI-INSTALL] Show what the user sees after successful installation.
// Include example output, first command to try, etc.
// Delete this comment block and replace with post-install info:

[source,bash]
----
# [TODO-AI-INSTALL: Example first command after install]
----

=== Uninstall

Tell your AI: "Remove I, Human from my system"

// [TODO-AI-INSTALL] Provide manual uninstall commands as fallback:
[source,bash]
----
# [TODO-AI-INSTALL: Manual uninstall commands]
----

[[ai-implementation]]
== For AI Assistants: Implementation Guide

// ============================================================================
// THIS IS THE RECIPE YOUR AI FOLLOWS.
// Be extremely specific. Include exact commands, exact URLs, exact file
// contents. The AI executing this has never seen your project before.
// ============================================================================

=== When User Asks to Install I, Human

==== Step 1: Determine Setup

Ask the user:

// [TODO-AI-INSTALL] Write the exact questions the AI should ask.
// Format as a copy-pasteable block the AI can show the user.
// Delete this comment block and replace:

----
I can help you set up I, Human. Before we start:

1. [TODO-AI-INSTALL: Question for AI to ask]
2. [TODO-AI-INSTALL: Question for AI to ask]
----

==== Step 2: Check Prerequisites

// [TODO-AI-INSTALL] List every prerequisite with version requirements
// and the exact commands to check/install them.
// Delete this comment block and replace:

[source,bash]
----
# Check prerequisites
# [TODO-AI-INSTALL: Exact version check commands]
# Example:
#   elixir --version    # Need 1.15+
#   rustc --version     # Need 1.75+
#   git --version       # Any recent version
----

If prerequisites are missing, install them:

// [TODO-AI-INSTALL] Provide install commands per OS/platform.
// Cover at minimum: Fedora, Ubuntu/Debian, macOS, asdf.
// Delete this comment block and replace:

----
# Fedora/RHEL
# [TODO-AI-INSTALL: dnf install commands]

==== Step 3: Present Privacy Notice

**ALWAYS show this BEFORE any installation commands. Wait for explicit "yes".**

----
I, Human PRIVACY & SECURITY NOTICE

I, Human will:
- [TODO-AI-INSTALL: What it does -- data access, network, storage]

I, Human will NOT:
- [TODO-AI-INSTALL: What it does NOT do -- privacy guarantees]

[TODO-AI-INSTALL: Storage locations, credential handling, audit logging]

Do you understand and accept? (yes/no)
----

==== Step 4: Install

// [TODO-AI-INSTALL] The COMPLETE installation command block.
// This should be a single copy-paste block that does everything.
// Include: clone, build, config creation, model downloads, etc.
// Delete this comment block and replace:

[source,bash]
----
# I, Human Installation
# [TODO-AI-INSTALL: Complete installation commands]
#
# Example structure:
#   git clone https://github.com/hyperpolymath/i-human
#   cd i-human
#   [build commands]
#   [config creation]
#   [any downloads]
#   [verification command]

==== Step 5: Configure Credentials (if applicable)

// [TODO-AI-INSTALL] If your project needs API keys, tokens, or other
// credentials, provide EXACT instructions for each service:
//   - URL to create the credential
//   - What scopes/permissions are needed
//   - The exact export command
// If no credentials needed, delete this section.
// Delete this comment block and replace:

===== [TODO-AI-INSTALL: Service Name]

----
To create a [credential type]:

1. Go to: [TODO-AI-INSTALL: Exact URL]
2. [TODO-AI-INSTALL: Step-by-step]
3. Copy the token

Then run:
export [TODO-AI-INSTALL: ENV_VAR]=[value]
----

==== Step 6: Configure Integration (if applicable)

// [TODO-AI-INSTALL] If your project integrates with other tools
// (MCP server for Claude Code, function definitions for ChatGPT, etc.)
// provide the exact configuration.
// If no integration needed, delete this section.

==== Step 7: Verify Installation

// [TODO-AI-INSTALL] A safe verification command (dry-run or status check)
// that proves everything is working. Include expected output.
// Delete this comment block and replace:

[source,bash]
----
# [TODO-AI-INSTALL: Verification command]
----

Expected output:

----
