== AI-Assisted Installation (Recommended)

=== Just Say It

**You don't need to read this README.** Just say this to any AI assistant:

[source,text]
----
Set up I, Human from https://github.com/hyperpolymath/i-human
----

**The URL is the spec.** The AI fetches this repo, reads the installation guide inside it, and handles everything. You answer a few questions and confirm the privacy notice. No commands to type, no installers to figure out, no docs to read.

Any AI that can read a URL and run commands (or generate commands for you to paste) can do this. The guide inside the repo tells the AI everything.

The AI handles:

// [TODO-AI-INSTALL] Replace this list with what your project's AI setup actually does.
// Examples from real repos:
//   neurophone: "Installing Termux, Rust, building for your hardware, downloading the LLM model"
//   feedback-o-tron: "Installing Elixir, building the CLI, walking through credential setup"
// Delete this comment block and replace:

* [TODO-AI-INSTALL: What the AI does during setup -- 4-6 bullet points]

=== Other Ways to Say It

If your AI already knows about I, Human (web search, training data), shorter versions work:

// [TODO-AI-INSTALL] Replace with natural-language variations specific to your project.
// Delete this comment block and replace:

* "[TODO-AI-INSTALL: Short version without URL]"
* "[TODO-AI-INSTALL: Version mentioning specific use case]"

If it doesn't know the project, just include the URL:

* "Set up https://github.com/hyperpolymath/i-human on my machine"

=== What You'll Be Asked

Your AI will ask you:

// [TODO-AI-INSTALL] Same questions as in the AI_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.adoc.
// Delete this comment block and replace:

1. **[TODO-AI-INSTALL: Question 1]**
2. **[TODO-AI-INSTALL: Question 2]**
3. **Privacy confirmation** -- what the tool does and how your data is handled

That's it. Everything else is automatic.

=== Privacy & Security Notice

[IMPORTANT]
====
// [TODO-AI-INSTALL] Same privacy notice as in the AI_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.adoc.
// Delete this comment block and replace:

**What I, Human does:**

* [TODO-AI-INSTALL: What it does]

**What I, Human does NOT do:**

* [TODO-AI-INSTALL: What it does NOT do]

**You control everything.** Uninstall anytime.

=== After Install

// [TODO-AI-INSTALL] Brief post-install usage example.
// Delete this comment block and replace:

[source,bash]
----
# [TODO-AI-INSTALL: Example first command after install]
----

=== Uninstall

Tell your AI: "Remove I, Human from my system"

=== Troubleshooting

// [TODO-AI-INSTALL] 3-5 most common issues. Keep brief -- the AI
// can read the full troubleshooting in the installation guide.
